Hi! I am a self-taught, open-source network, software, and systems engineer. I enjoy working with Linux, web development, network engineering and security, penetration testing, and game development.

Join [Deaconn's](https://deaconn.net/) Discord [server](https://discord.deaconn.net/) if you want to contact me or want a relaxed server focused on technology, gaming, and sport discussions!

## My Active Open Source Projects
### Gaming
| Name | Source | Discord | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [The Modding Community](https://moddingcommunity.com/) | [Link](https://github.com/modcommunity) | [Yes](https://discord.moddingcommunity.com/) | An upcoming inclusive modding community and game developer that currently offers a [forum](https://forum.moddingcommunity.com) and, in the future, will provide a mod workshop, server browser, and much more! We support popular games like [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us), [GTA V](https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-v), [Skyrim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/), [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/), and many others! |
| [Best Mods](https://bestmods.io) | [Link](https://github.com/bestmods/bestmods) | [Yes](https://discord.moddingcommunity.com/) | A global index for video game mods where you can find and rate mods from many sources on the Internet.
| [Browser.TF](https://btf.bestservers.io) | [Link](https://github.com/gamemann/Browser.TF) | [Yes](https://discord.deaconn.net/) | A web-sided server browser for the game Team Fortress 2 I made back in 2015/2016 while in High School. The domain used to be `browser.tf` and fairly active, but was unfortunately lost in mid-2022. As a result, it is now [btf.bestservers.io](https://btf.bestservers.io).


### Tech
| Name | Source | Discord | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [Deaconn](https://deaconn.net/) | [Link](https://github.com/deaconn-net) | [Yes](https://discord.deaconn.net/) | My portfolio, blog, and future IT company/community, with the goal of assisting and bringing together developers and security/network engineers. |
| [Packet Batch](https://github.com/Packet-Batch) | [Link](https://github.com/Packet-Batch) | [Yes](https://discord.deaconn.net/) | A collection of high-performing applications that act as pen-test/DoS tools ([Denial Of Service](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/)).
| [XDP Firewall](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall) | [Link](https://github.com/gamemann/XDP-Firewall) | [Yes](https://discord.deaconn.net/) | A stateless firewall that utilizes the Linux kernel's [XDP](https://www.iovisor.org/technology/xdp) hook for fast packet processing. This is great for dropping [(D)DoS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/) attacks!

I also have many other semi-active/inactive open source projects which may be found on my profile!
