Hi! I am a self-taught network, software, and systems engineer with a love for open source. I enjoy working with Linux, web development, network engineering and security, penetration testing, and game development.

## My Projects
| Name | Category | Source | Discord | Description |

We support popular games like [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us), [GTA V](https://www.rockstargames.com/gta-v), [Skyrim](https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/The_Elder_Scrolls_V_Skyrim_Special_Edition/), [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/), and many others! |

The domain used to be `browser.tf` and fairly active, but was unfortunately lost in mid-2022. As a result, it is now [btf.bestservers.io](https://btf.bestservers.io).

I also have many other semi-active/inactive open source projects which may be found on my profile!
