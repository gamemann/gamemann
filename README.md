Check out **[NextGen Modding](https://github.com/NextGen-Modding)**! We are working on **open-source** tools that will allow game developers to take their community-made content to the next level with the power of modding! We will be supporting [Unity](https://unity.com/), [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/), and [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org/). I also have other neat open source projects that I'm looking for help on as well below ðŸ˜„

Join my Discord [server](https://discord.deaconn.net/) if you want to contact me or want a relaxed server focused on technology, gaming, and sports discussions! Discord is the best way to get in contact with me and I will be posting a lot of updates regarding my projects below there!

### Why Did You Follow Me?
I **manually** follow users because I'm looking for less popular projects to support and contribute to. I love reading code from others and contributing to the open source community!

### My Main Projects
#### Best Mods
[BestMods.io](https://bestmods.io) is an [open source](https://github.com/BestMods) website that lists many mods for any game! It retrieves data from multiple sources on the Internet and is powered by the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity) and I! The website is still *in development*.

#### The Modding Community

We are a community that is taking [modding](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSlROYETsWYlJkqM7y9J5qeHRjh6ZY6Liv0RIkxSX6EjQ7X3_kzQFkp3HNHtebks8YAe3e2QV2lBmka/pub?slide=id.g155efb98b4d_0_10) to the next level by providing a unique marketplace, server and community discovery/browser (with match-making systems and flexible integration for game developers), and forum for modders. With that said, we are working with open source game engines such as [Godot](https://godotengine.org) to create and improve modding tools.

We are also creating an open source base game with a focus on modding and cross-platform support! Check it out [here](https://github.com/modcommunity/Base-Game)!

#### Gamecom
[Gamecom.io](https://gamecom.io) is similar to [@BestMods](https://github.com/BestMods) and is also powered by the [@modcommunity](https://github.com/modcommunity). However, it will additionally list communities, servers, games, and more!

#### Past Projects
* [Games For Life](https://GFLClan.com/) - Multi-gaming community (founded and owned from January 25th, 2011 to July 13th, 2021).
* [Browser.TF](https://browser.tf/) - A neat web-sided server browser I made in 2015/2016 for the game Team Fortress 2 until October of 2022, when I couldn't afford the domain, the domain went to the market, and another entity got it to resell, but isn't responding to any of my requests (since I now have the money). Mega RIP and website's source code [here](https://github.com/gamemann/Browser.TF).
* [The Developing Community](https://thedevelopingcommunity.com) - Old community I tried starting in 2014 or 2015 to bring together other developers. Website source code [here](https://github.com/gamemann/Misc/tree/master/tdc_site)!
