Software/network engineer interested in many areas within technology.

Check out my [projects](https://github.com/gamemann/gamemann/blob/main/projects.md) including [The Modding Community](https://moddingcommunity.com/)!

Join my Discord [server](https://discord.deaconn.net/) if you want to contact me or want a relaxed server focused on technology, gaming, and sports discussions! Discord is the best way to get in contact with me and I will be posting a lot of updates regarding my projects there!

### Why Did You Follow Me?
I **manually** follow users because I'm looking for less popular projects to support and contribute to. I love reading code from others and contributing to the open source community!

Check out [Deaconn](https://deaconn.net/) for my resume, blog, and more about [me](https://github.com/gamemann/gamemann/blob/main/me.md) as a person.
