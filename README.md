Working on multiple [projects](https://github.com/gamemann/gamemann/blob/main/projects.md) to prove gaming can be so much better than what it is currently with the power of open source and modding. Check out our presentation on [The Modding Community](https://moddingcommunity.com/) and what our vision is [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vSlROYETsWYlJkqM7y9J5qeHRjh6ZY6Liv0RIkxSX6EjQ7X3_kzQFkp3HNHtebks8YAe3e2QV2lBmka/pub?slide=id.p)!

Join my Discord [server](https://discord.deaconn.net/) if you want to contact me or want a relaxed server focused on technology, gaming, and sports discussions! Discord is the best way to get in contact with me and I will be posting a lot of updates regarding my projects there!

### Why Did You Follow Me?
I **manually** follow users because I'm looking for less popular projects to support and contribute to. I love reading code from others and contributing to the open source community!

Check out [Deaconn](https://deaconn.net/) for my resume, blog, and more about me as a person.
